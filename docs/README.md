# Typometric Analysis Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the typometric analysis pipeline. This directory contains guides on methodology, usage, visualization, and technical architecture.

## 1. Getting Started
*   **[Analysis Guide](VERB_CENTERED_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md)**: High-level overview of the verb-centered analysis approach and core concepts.
*   **[Config Quickstart](CONFIG_EXAMPLES_QUICKSTART.md)**: Examples and instructions for configuring and running the analysis pipeline.

## 2. The Helix Table
The Helix Table is the primary output visualization for dependency data.
*   **[User Guide](HELIX_TABLE_USER_GUIDE.md)**: How to read, interpret, and navigate the Helix Table.
*   **[Methodology](HELIX_TABLE_METHODOLOGY.md)**: Detailed mathematical clarification of how values (sizes, factors) are calculated.

## 3. Visualizations
*   **[Plot Documentation](PLOT_DOCUMENTATION.md)**: Comprehensive guide to the ~800+ plots generated by the pipeline, including file naming conventions, grouping, and specific metric definitions (MAL, HCS, Diagonal Factors, etc.).

## 4. Metrics & Definitions
*   **[Sentence Disorder](SENTENCE_DISORDER_GUIDE.md)**: Explanation of "disorder" and "entropy" metrics used to quantify word order flexibility.
*   **[Word Order Classification](WORD_ORDER_CLASSIFICATION.md)**: Criteria and formulas used to classify languages as VO, OV, Head-Initial, etc.
*   **[Geometric Means](GEOMETRIC_MEAN_INFO.md)**: Explanation of why geometric means are used for aggregation and how they handle outliers.

## 5. Technical Architecture & Development
*   **[Pipeline Architecture](PIPELINE_ARCHITECTURE.md)**: Overview of the system design, data flow, and file structure.
*   **[Sample vs Global Investigation](HTML_SAMPLE_VS_GLOBAL_INVESTIGATION.md)**: Findings from investigations into consistency between HTML samples and global statistics.
